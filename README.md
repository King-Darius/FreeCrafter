FreeCrafter is an experimental 3D modeling sandbox built with Qt and OpenGL. It currently provides a minimal interface and a handful of prototype tools for sketching and extruding simple geometry.

## Features
- Qt-based desktop interface with a custom OpenGL viewport
- Camera controller supporting orbit, pan, and zoom
- Geometry kernel that stores curves and extruded solids
- Tools for selection, freehand sketching on the ground plane, and basic extrusion

## Building

The repository ships with a helper script that fetches a minimal Qt runtime and
builds the project for you. After cloning, simply run:

```bash
python scripts/bootstrap.py
```

The script downloads the necessary Qt libraries using the openâ€‘source
`aqtinstall` tool, configures CMake with that Qt, compiles FreeCrafter, and runs
the appropriate deployment utility so the resulting executable already includes
the Qt runtime.

The built program can be found in the `build` directory and should run on a
machine without any additional setup.

Though we hope to skip even this step in future.

## Resources
Icon assets are stored under `resources/icons` and bundled using Qt's resource system.  They are currently only dummy assets.
