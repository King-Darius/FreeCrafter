# Phase 6 Implementation Assessment

## Executive Summary
Phase 6 is now feature-complete. The advanced modeling suite delivers the rail-aware lofting, fillet/chamfer tooling, precision cutting, quad retopology, Catmull–Clark subdivision, cloth simulation, and CAD-centric workflows promised in the roadmap. All behaviours are exercised by regression tests that validate geometry, attribute tagging, and downstream interoperability.

## Detailed Verification

### Round Corner
* Supports per-corner fillet/chamfer overrides and hard/soft edge tagging that persist in `Curve` metadata.
* Tests confirm override handling and welding with directional constraints.

### CurveIt Lofting
* Generates multi-section skins with twist control, optional caps, and rail-aware centroid paths.
* Laplacian smoothing maintains surface quality.

### PushANDPull
* Produces watertight inner/outer shells with quad sidewalls, caps, and metadata refresh.
* Shell creation is re-used by CADDesigner for Pull+ style operations.

### Surface & BezierKnife
* Surface drawing projects onto actual mesh triangles with collision-aware offsets and optional remeshing.
* Knife cutting removes interior faces along Bézier paths and updates the solid mesh while returning an imprint curve.

### QuadTools & SubD
* Retopology guarantees quad-only meshes, merging paired triangles and reflowing higher-order polygons.
* Catmull–Clark subdivision computes face/edge/vertex points and rebuilds quad cages per iteration.

### Weld, Vertex Tools, Clean
* Welding honours directional tolerances with union-find grouping.
* Soft selection adds weighted translation, rotation, and scaling.
* Clean rebuilds meshes while culling tiny faces and unused vertices.

### ClothEngine
* Adds pinning, weight maps, and simple collider volumes to the PBD solver.

### CAD Designer
* Extends revolve/sweep with twist-aware skins, plus shell, mirror, split, pattern, and imprint helpers.

### Test Coverage
* `tests/test_phase6.cpp` exercises each workflow, validating topology (quad counts, face reductions) and behavioural contracts (pinning, edge tagging, collider response, CAD patterns).

## Conclusion
Phase 6 delivers the integrated advanced toolset described in the roadmap. Algorithms and helpers are production ready, and the regression suite provides guardrails for future changes.
