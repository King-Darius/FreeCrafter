# Sanity Check Report — 11 Feb 2025

## Summary
- Ran `pytest tests/test_bootstrap.py` inside a fresh virtual environment; all 15 bootstrap tests passed, confirming the helper script's offline/CI behaviors.  See the test log below for details.
- Native C++ regression tests (`ctest` targets such as `test_render`) remain blocked without a Qt runtime; building requires downloading ~Qt 6.5 binaries through `scripts/bootstrap.py`.
- Roadmap progress is unchanged since the last update: only the "Tools" milestone (B) is marked complete, while rendering, DSM, plugins, and later phases remain open.
- Packaging and dependency management are in place via `scripts/bootstrap.py`, `scripts/requirements.txt`, the vendored Qt manifest, and CPack configuration.

## Test Log
```text
pytest tests/test_bootstrap.py
```

All tests passed. For raw output, see the execution transcript captured during this run.

## Roadmap Snapshot
- Milestone completion flags currently show:
  - Rendering (A): ☐
  - Tools (B): ☑
  - DSM (C): ☐
  - Plugins (D): ☐
  - File I/O (E): ☐
  - UI Polish (F): ☐
  - Performance & Stability (G): ☐
  - QA & Release (H): ☐
- Phase 4 and beyond (drawing, object management, advanced tools, etc.) are still open items, with the newly scheduled Phase 11 surface painting milestone yet to start.

## Dependency & Packaging Notes
- `scripts/bootstrap.py` orchestrates dependency installation, Qt acquisition, CMake configuration, and bundling; it respects offline caches, CI-friendly flags, and installation prefixes.
- Python package requirements for the bootstrap workflow are tracked in `scripts/requirements.txt` (aqtinstall, PySimpleGUI, pyinstaller).
- The pinned Qt runtime definition lives in `qt/manifest.json`, ensuring consistent module selection.
- CMake/CPack settings in `CMakeLists.txt` already configure NSIS, DragNDrop, and TGZ packaging targets and generate deploy scripts when available.
